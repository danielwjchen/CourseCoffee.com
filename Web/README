		  those in the alphabet. The first letter letter in every word shall be
			capitalized, including the first work, e.g. UserDao.php, UserModel.php.
2. Special words
    - words such as 'Controller', 'Modell', 'View' are reserved by the system,
		  this also includes the obvious.

1. Create a mysql database.
2. Copy the ./default.config.php and rename it ./config.php
3. Change the values to your configuration
4. Run ./install.php 
5. Change the permission to /files to public writable to allow uploads
