== README ==
This system relies heavily on JavaScript. It uses JQuery and Jquery UI as the 
default framework and attempts at following the Model-view-controller (MVC) 
software architecture concept to implement featrues. However, the current 
design is quite broken in terms of following the MVC guidelines, and a major
revamp is planned in the future.

== File Structure ==
 - main.js
   contains most used methods and functions that are shared acrossed the pages.

 - controller/
   contains scripts that are handle input events, and they are named after the
	 page which they are responsible of.

 - model/
   contains scripts that handle the application logic and JSON communication 
	 with the server. They are reusable and page independent.
